## Examples directory

Here you can find several examples of using Motodriver library.   
They are basic programs and wiring schemas which are meant to introduce you to various aspects of the Motodriver library.   

These examples were made using **Arduino IDE** 1.8.19 version and with **Arduino UNO** microcontroller board.   

* **Example 1**: Introduces basic sketch skeleton for controlling a pair of DC engines via L298N 2X motor driver shield.   

* **Example 2**: Introduces sketch for controlling a pair DC engines as joint moving group via L298N 2X motor driver shields.   

* **Example 3**: Introduces sketch demonastrates complex movement with turns and U-turns.
